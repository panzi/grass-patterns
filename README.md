This is my attempt to create an image in the patterns the wind makes in grass.
The image is created through the intersections of the "blades of grass" only.

I implemented it very naively and so it's performance is very lacking. One could
probably boost the performance extremely by reimplementing it using OpenGL shaders,
but I have no experience with OpenGL.
