This is my attempt to create an image in the patterns the wind makes in grass.

[Online Demo](http://panzi.github.io/grass-patterns/)

I implemented it very naively and so it's performance is very lacking. One could
probably boost the performance extremely by reimplementing it using OpenGL shaders,
but I have no experience with OpenGL.
