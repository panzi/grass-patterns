This is my attempt to create an image in the patterns the wind makes in grass.
The image is created through the intersections of the "blades of grass" only.
This is effect is called a [moiré pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern).

I implemented it very naively and so it's performance is very lacking. One could
probably boost the performance extremely by reimplementing it using OpenGL shaders,
but I have no experience with OpenGL.

I haven't found any resources on how to create images using moiré patterns in
a quick Google search. Usually you want to remove them from your images so I
only find information about that.
